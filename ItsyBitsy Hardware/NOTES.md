# UM Development Notes

## Benchmarks
* 21.01.30 Arm can run forwards, backwards in same program
* 21.01.29 Arm can run variable speed programs
* 21.01.25 Arm runs backwards and forwards in response to switch
* 21.01.25 limit switches respected 

## Goals
- [ ] write calibration routine for getting HOME_LOW and HOME_HIGH
- [ ] write variety of attack/retreat routines
- [ ] arm can pause during program
- [ ] randomly select attack/retreat routine
- [ ] random seed based on internal processor temp
