# Useless Machine

## *Absolutely Useless, Completely Necessary*

![UM Demo](./Useless_Machine.gif)

This useless machine comes with everything you need to laser cut and assemble a box and add hardware of your choice. Both designs physically disconnect the batteries when not in use to provide months and months of useless uselessness!

It even comes in two flavors:
## [ItsyBitsy Version](ItsyBitsy_Version/ItsyBitsy_README.md)

The ItsyBitsy version is sassy, slightly passive aggressive, has lights, is programmable and hackable! It runs on AdaFruit's Circuit Python and code is well documented and easily modified with options for adding additional attack/retreat modes.

There's even a PCB schematic you can spin out from OSH Park or one of the other fab houses.
## [555 Timer Version ](555_Version/555_README.md)

This version is a fun way to explore PWM and 555 timers. The venerable 555 is a great tool for making das blinken lights, but also for driving pulse-width-modulated hardware like servos.

The 555 Version requires just a few parts and can be fabricated at home with protoboard or etching your own circuit. There are resist masks, drill instructions, a BOM and everything you need to build a your own 555 Useless Machine.

## [The Box](./enclosure/Enclosure_README.md)

Fire up the pew-pew laser and make yourself a box! Everything you need to create your own laser-cut box is here including DXF, SVG, artwork and OpenSCAD files. The DXF and SVG versions are set up for 4mm birch ply. If you intend to use something thicker or thinner, make sure you generate a new layout using the OpenSCAD files.

The OpenSCAD version is customizable takes advantage of the OpenSCAD customizer interface. M
